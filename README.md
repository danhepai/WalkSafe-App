# Welcome to WalkSafe!

WalkSafe is a mobile application designed to provide users with safe and enjoyable walking routes tailored to their preferences. Developed during the M100 Cities - InnovateTech 
for Climate hackathon in cooperation with Babes-Boylai University of Cluj-Napoca, this project integrates advanced technologies to enhance urban mobility and walking experiences.

**Project Overview:**

The application is a mobile app that focuses on providing a route to the user's desired destination. What makes it **unique** is the ability to personalize the route so that it follows certain 'tags', such as "Water Supply", "No Pollution", "Sunny", "Shady" and much more to be added. After 2 months of development, the team got the 4th place, awarded with €1500.

The development team was formed by 5 people, including myself, working mostly on the front-end part of the application due to its complexity.

**Features**
1. _Customizable Routes & Directions_: Users can personalize their walking routes using tags such as "Water Supply", "No Pollution", etc. After starting the route, the user gets on the navigation view where directions are given to follow the path.
2. _User Profile_: Each user has a personalized profile page with their photo, his routes and his achievements.
3. _Light&Dark Mode_: The application offers both modes for improved accessibility.
4. _AI-Optimized Routes_: Routes are intelligently generated for safety and enjoyment using the A* algorithm and tools like OpenAI and QGIS.
5. _Community Feedback_: Over 250+ users validated the app concept through surveys.

**Tehnologies Used**
1. _React Native_ for the front end.
2. _Pyhton with Django Framework_ for the backend.
3. _Fast API & QGIS_ for the AI route generating.
4. _PostgreSQL_ for the database.
5. _OpenAI_ for formating the route.
6. _MapBox and Waze_ for smooth navigation and map.

**Datasets**
The data used for route configuration and optimization were sourced from public API like Google APIs, Waze APIs and also from datasets from the Cluj-Napoca City Hall including water sources, green spaces, tree cover and urban areas.
